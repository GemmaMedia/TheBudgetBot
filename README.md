# The BudgetBot

This project requires Replit.com to run as well as the latest version of Python. 

The branches are split into the following:

- main.py - This is the main method where all the Python code is stored which controls the function of the 'BudgetBot'. I have also included comments within the code '#' to explain each function. 

- poetry.lock - This is the font and layout of the program. 

- pyproject.toml - This is the Python package extension to run in Replit.
